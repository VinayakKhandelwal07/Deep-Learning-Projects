Cat-Dog Classification Web Application
Overview
Welcome to the Cat-Dog Classification Web Application! This web-based tool leverages a powerful machine learning model to accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs. Built with Flask, this application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and receiving instant classification results.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: Easily upload images of cats or dogs through a straightforward web form.
Real-Time Classification: Our model processes and classifies the uploaded image in seconds.
Model Accuracy: Based on advanced deep learning techniques, the model has been trained on a vast dataset, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.
How It Works
Upload Your Image: Choose an image file from your device that you believe is either a cat or a dog.
Image Processing: Once the image is uploaded, it is sent to our Flask backend, where it is processed by our pre-trained machine learning model.
Classification Result: The model analyzes the image and returns the classification result — either "Cat" or "Dog" — along with a confidence score.
Technical Details
Machine Learning Model: The classification model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), known for their effectiveness in image recognition tasks.
Flask Framework: Flask serves as the lightweight web server handling user requests and integrating the machine learning model with the web interface.
Deployment: The application is designed to be easily deployed on various platforms, ensuring accessibility and convenience.
